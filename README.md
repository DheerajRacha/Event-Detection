# Event-Detection
Python Implementation of the paper Event Detection in Social Streams

"Social networks generate a large amount of text content over
time because of continuous interaction between participants. The
mining of such social streams is more challenging than traditional
text streams, because of the presence of both text content and
implicit network structure within the stream. The problem of event
detection is also closely related to clustering, because the events
can only be inferred from aggregate trend changes in the stream. In
this paper, we will study the two related problems of clustering and
event detection in social streams. We will study both the supervised
and unsupervised case for the event detection problem. We present
experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of incorporating
network structure in event discovery over purely content-based
methods."
